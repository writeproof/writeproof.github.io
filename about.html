    <h1>About WriteProof</h1>

    <h2>What is WriteProof?</h2>
    <p>WriteProof is a free, open-source tool that creates cryptographic proof of authentic human writing. By recording every keystroke with precise timestamps and generating tamper-proof hash chains, WriteProof lets writers demonstrate their work is genuinely theirs.</p>

    <h2>Why did we build this?</h2>
    <p>Academic integrity matters. With AI writing tools becoming ubiquitous, students and writers need ways to prove their work is authentic. But existing solutions are invasive, expensive, or unreliable.</p>
    <p>WriteProof offers a better approach: transparent, privacy-respecting, and free. Instead of surveillance or plagiarism detection, we give writers the tools to proactively demonstrate their authorship.</p>

    <h2>Who built this?</h2>
    <p>WriteProof was created by <strong>Franklin R. Castillo</strong>, Data Science and Programming Faculty at St. Petersburg College, St. Petersburg, FL.</p>
    <p>The project is open source and welcomes contributions from the community.</p>

    <h2>How is it funded?</h2>
    <p>WriteProof is free and always will be. No ads, no subscriptions, no data collection. If you find it valuable, consider:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contributing code on <a href="https://github.com/writeproof/writeproof" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a></li>
      <li>Sharing it with others who might benefit</li>
      <li>Providing feedback to improve the tool</li>
      <li><a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/writeproof" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy me a coffee</a> if you want to support development</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Support Development</h2>
    <p>WriteProof will always be free, but if it's helped you and you'd like to support continued development, you can buy me a coffee. Every contribution helps cover hosting costs and motivates continued improvement.</p>

    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-muted" style="margin-top: 1rem;">No pressure &mdash; the tool works the same whether you contribute or not. Your feedback and word-of-mouth support matter just as much.</p>

    <h2>Open Source</h2>
    <p>WriteProof is open source under the MIT License. Inspect the code, contribute improvements, or fork it for your own use. Academic integrity tools should be transparent and trustworthy.</p>
